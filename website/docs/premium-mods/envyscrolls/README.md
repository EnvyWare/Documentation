## Description

ClueScrolls are an item that a player receives with steps that slowly reveal themselves for them to complete. After completing each step the next will reveal, this is important as otherwise the player will know if the clue scroll is too difficult to complete and as such would immediately trash the item if they could see all the future steps.

Typically you have four different tiers of clue scroll, each with progressively harder clue steps and as such progressively better rewards. Thus creating an environment where the higher tiers are rarer, and in higher demand, as they take more time to complete but are very worthwhile.

Often, players enjoy servers that include a wide variety of clue steps to keep players on their toes and intersted in doing more clue scrolls. Some of the most interesting steps are those that are not inherently obvious, for example using a riddle can be more interesting as it requires more thought than just "Mine X Blocks of Y type"&#x20;

Clue Skips are typically a rare, premium, item that are used to skip steps that a player may find too difficult. They are consumed upon use to make them more valuable.



Mystery scrolls are an item used to randomly distribute the different clue scroll rarities. You can define different tiers so you could have rarer mystery scrolls that are more likely to give out the higher tiers of clue scroll.
