**Purchases:**

`When you make a purchase with EnvyWare, you are acquiring a license to access our products. Product prices are subject to change at our discretion. By making a purchase, you confirm that you have thoroughly reviewed and accepted our terms of service. It's important to note that being banned from the EnvyWare Discord server does not entitle you to a refund and is considered a violation of this agreement.`&#x20;

**Refunds and Downloads:**&#x20;

`All sales are final, and refunds will not be granted. Download links will be provided through channels within the EnvyWare Discord. These downloads are strictly for the purchaser's use and cannot be shared. The license you receive is valid only for the server(s) specified in your invoice, whether for a single server or a network license for multiple servers. There is no implied warranty, support, or promise of future updates with your purchase. By choosing to make a purchase, you are waiving the 14-day cooling-off period as outlined in the Consumer Contracts Regulations, allowing you to access downloads immediately. If you opt not to waive this cooling-off period, downloads will be available to you after 14 days. This policy does not affect your statutory right to a 30-day refund window for returning faulty products. A plugin is not considered faulty if it requires an update to meet your specific requirements. Thank you for choosing EnvyWare Ltd, and we appreciate your understanding of these terms.`
