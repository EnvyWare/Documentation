# BetterPokeBroadcaster

Welcome to the BetterPokeBroadcaster wiki!

BetterPokeBroadcaster is a Pixelmon sidemod that allows you to configure broadcasts, and player messages, for when
given events occur on the server. For example, you can now broadcast a formatted message to your entire server
when a legendary Pokemon spawns, or when a player defeats a legendary Pokemon. You can then add a webhook onto
the same broadcast logic to send the same message to a Discord channel!

For configuration help visit the [`Config`](config.md) page.
