# XAMPP Installation

First off, you should go [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to download xampp and begin the process.\
This process if fairly easy and super simple to use to setup any MySQL database as well as other features such as FileZilla which is a FTP (File Transfer Protocol).\
\
FileZilla will allow you to transfer files from any system, provided you have a stable internet connection.

Apache is what will allow you to connect to your PHPmyadmin which is your local browsing access to the SQL Databases on your network.
