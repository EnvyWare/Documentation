You will then want to start MySQL and Apache (You can start FileZilla too if that's something you want although we will not cover that setup here).\
\
Once you enable those, make sure their ports are open and available, if not, it should give you an error. _(You will most likely want to remove whatever other program that is using their ports as they are default for the application usage)._

Next up, you are going to want to make sure they start up with your system, click the Config button at the top right of the main UI.\
\
_(This is what should appear)._ \

Make sure that both Apache and MySQL are check marked otherwise you will not be able to use them correctly together. Then press save.\
\
Now Lastly, go back to the Main UI and press admin for the MySQL section. This will open your PhpMyAdmin which is your browser access to your local database information.
